            This is a free fantasy game. What distinguishes her from other titles of this type is a large dose of violence and the vulgar vocabulary that independent heroes spare no effort.

            The game is about a mystical lady called Trieste that appears when the two moons cross. Trieste arrives in a land conquered by evil and manages to seal the door with her own blood, locking out hordes of beasts, and impending doom.

            At the start of this game, you pick one and from there, you’re surrounded by evil. What you do is up to you, but you hear that if you can survive until the two moons cross again, then the prophecy says that Trieste will return once more…

            The current invasion of the Pitborn hordes of the Abyss has spread from Crespo, threatening to overrun Heiharp and spread to Ares in the northeast and Morte in the south.

            Braiken Castle is the center of the final Northern defense line of the Kashmir Mts, while Loa Castle guards the southern regions. Since, currently, there is no way to get through the polluted area; failing to defend these areas may directly result in the fall of the entire continent.

            The world presented in 2Moons does not differ too much from fantasy standards. So we have a gate sealed centuries ago leading to the Abyss – the hellish, inhabited by the nightmarish and cruel beings of the dimension, which reopens. The evil crawls into the world, and its inhabitants plunge into war counting on the arrival of the legendary Trieste, the White Lady, who once managed to deal with the threat. It was announced in a prophecy. It is supposed to happen when both moons shining over the world of Haran are aligned. So far, however, the only law in force is the law of the sword, and the motto of the majority of the inhabitants is: “There is no mercy on the weak, no regret on the dying, no tears on the murdered”.

            At the beginning of the game, we choose the character we are going to play. We have twelve races/competitions at our disposal. Those who prefer to fight can choose the Bagi Warrior, a powerful warrior who can use the forces of nature to awaken the fury in him. Those who believe in knightly ideals may be tempted to become a warrior of the Azure Order, a proud defender of Haran, and a faithful servant of Trieste.

            Magic lovers can choose a character belonging to the Incara Order. These are people who, thanks to years of meditation and exercise, have possessed the ability to control the elements. Another race is Segnale – refugees from the Abyss who decided to settle in Haran. They know many dark secrets, and their power is mostly based on the magic of blood – vampirism. “From the blood, we take away to the blood we give. – they used to talk about the source of their skills.

            The most mysterious people are Summoners. Strongly connected with dark powers, they often come into contact with the inhabitants of the abyss. They are very dangerous warriors who used to support their attacks with black magic.

          <LbParagraph>
            Those who are closest to contact with nature, hunting, distance fighting, and quick flushing through the bushes, will surely choose a Segita type hero. They are seasoned hunters and archers.

            The gameplay itself does not differ much from what other productions of this type have accustomed us to. We travel the world, perform tasks, fight monsters and gain experience. We then use them to enhance the value of our qualities and skills. We also equip ourselves with better and better armor and weapons. We can trade with other players, exchange items, and take part in missions together. When we get tired of fighting, we can look for relaxation, grab the rod, lures, and go fishing.

            They called it The Corruption, those charged with the telling of the story. When the two moons aligned, the exiled king, Rictus, bid his magician open the gate and unleash the pestilence of the Pitborn and their dark ruler Abaddon upon Haran, The Immortal Land. In his hubris, Rictus thought he might control them, that he might herald his conquering of Haran on the crest of a black wave of the accursed. But there could be no alliance with Abaddon, the lord of the pit whose blessing is pain, whose enchantment is the wage of sorrow. He bound Rictus in the darkness of the abyss and every time a man fell to claw, tooth or blade, every time a woman or child burned to black flesh, choked to blue or starved to sallow skin, Rictus died their death and lived to die again. This for all eternity, for such was the will of Abaddon.

            The Pitborn flooded Haran, the wake of their butchery staining crimson the once proud soil of The Immortal Land. Mankind teetered on the brink of annihilation. In the depth of his sorrow, overwhelmed by hopelessness, their king, Tirus The Grim, succumbed to death by his own hand.

            Thence came Trieste, The White Lady â€“ prophet, magician, warrior, godchild, queen of frozen Haihaff. She bound together those with strength left to resist. To her aid came the dark magic of The Summoners, the power of The Incar, the blades of The Azure Order, the lethal arrows of The Segita, the brute strength of The Bagi, and the blessed touch of The Segnale. They made war then, blanketing the land with the hewed limbs of Pitborn. Their valor knew no equal, but their numbers were too few. The minions of Abaddon poured forth from the gate where they had waited for countless unhallowed centuries and their bloodlust could not be slaked. Despite their courage, the forces of Haran would fall.

          <LbParagraph>
            It was then that Trieste left in secret. To the gate, she went, and slew there those who guarded its gaping maw. And there did she die, sealing shut the gate with her own lifeblood. Abaddon was drawn screaming back into the abyss and the children of Trieste prevailed.
          </LbParagraph>
          <LbParagraph>
            Centuries have passed and the enchantment of The White Lady has worn thin as she prophesied. The gate has cracked open and the Pitborn once again plague Haran. There is no safe passage and of the once proud cities, only Loa and Braiken remain. Yet, there is hope. The people of The Immortal Land resist. With bolt and blade, with conjured flame and summoned might they combat the minions of Abaddon. For it is said Trieste will return when once again the twin moons align. Until then, only the law of the sword remains – No mercy for the weak, no pity for the dying, no tears for the slain!
